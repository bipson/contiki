Priority 0:
* Smart-Meter: Implement Requester
* HTTP Binding: Implement endpoints
* HTTP Binding: Implement messages on endpoints

Priority 1:
* CoAP Observe: Implement chunked messages
* Get "values" from Cooja
* Integrate Contiki/CoAP into OMNET++

Priority 2:
* Contiki: fixed routing?

Won't Fix:
* CoAP Observe: Content Type of Requester not fixed (shortcoming of erbium)
  Fix: For Evaluations, just change content type programmatically depending on scenario
